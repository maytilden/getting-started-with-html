  <b>GETTING STARTED WITH THE WEB AND HTML</b><br>
<br>
<b>Web Fundamentals</b>
<p>Html is the main type of document/content on the web. When a person uses his or her browser to go to a webpage, that webpage is sending a HTTP request to a server. That server in turn finds the HTML doc and sends it back to the user's browser. The web browser then interprets this HTML.</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for Hyptertext Markup Language.HTML is made up of <i>text content</i>, which is what you see, and <i>mark up</i>, which is what that content looks like.</p>
<b>Tags and Elements</b>
  <p>HTML is made up of elements. Tags are then used to define these elements. An attribute is an element modifier. The anchor attribute is utilized to form links within elements. </p>
  <b>Block and Inline: What's the difference?</b>
  <p><i>Inline</i> tags differ from <i>block tags</i> because block tags form an invisible box around the content inside of them.</p>
